/* CODE REQUIREMENTS
1. Create the following variables:
 - firstName- holding your first name as a string
 - letIndex - holding a number that is smaller than the number of characters in your name
 - favoriteLetter - holding one random letter of your choice as a string
2. Create the charAtIndex variable, and use []  to store the character in your firstName at that letIndex. Log the charAtIndex to the console.
3. Compare the charAtIndex with your favoriteLetter to see if they are equal and console.log() the result.
4. Run your code by typing node strings.js in the terminal.
*/
/*Example:
Example
If your first name is "Julia" and you've chosen the letIndex of 3. Your charAtIndex will be i. Let's say you've set favoriteLetter to z, your final comparison should be false.
